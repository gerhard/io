title: Dagger beyond CI/CD
summary: Advanced Dagger functionalities beyond typical CI/CD workflows
abstract: |
    We start by discussing about different ways of connecting to the Dagger
    Engine.

    We then use a different Dagger module to deploy Dagger Engine on Fly.io and
    then connect to it via TCP (over IPv6 WireGuard).

    We wrap up by mentioning [On-Demand Dagger Engines with Argo CD, EKS and
    Karpenter](https://dagger.io/blog/argo-cd-kubernetes).
